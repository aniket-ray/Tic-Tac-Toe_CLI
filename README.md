# The Unbeatable game of TIC-TAC-TOE

[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) is an age old game. The rules of the game are pretty simple. We've built an unbeatable version of Tic-Tac-Toe. 

Under the hood, we've implemented the naive [MINIMAX Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) which chooses the best move possible. The game is built on C++11 and the [executable](https://github.com/aniketiq/Tic-Tac-Toe_CLI/blob/master/TicTacToe.out) file has been compiler under the following specifications.

```bash
Apple LLVM version 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin18.6.0
Thread model: posix
```

This is a Command-Line-Version of the game and "this" kinda gives you a nostalgic feeling. ðŸ˜›


Feel Free to compile the ```TicTacToe.cpp``` in your own environment.

We're looking forward to optimize the game by additional implementation of the [ALPHA-BETA PRUNING Algorthm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaâ€“beta_pruning).
